# Getting Started

Livewire has two halves: a **client** library you add to your app, and a **host** app you run on your desktop. This guide walks through both.

## 1. Add the client to your app

Add the client library to your app's dependencies:

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
dependencies {
  // Core SDK for integrating into your app
  implementation("com.livewire-kt.livewire:client:<version>")

  // SQLite Database Viewer
  implementation("com.livewire-kt.livewire:plugin-database:<version>")

  // Logs Viewer
  implementation("com.livewire-kt.livewire:plugin-logs:<version>")

  // Network Viewer
  implementation("com.livewire-kt.livewire:plugin-network-core:<version>")
  implementation("com.livewire-kt.livewire:plugin-network-ktor:<version>") // if using ktor
  implementation("com.livewire-kt.livewire:plugin-network-okhttp:<version>") // if using okhttp

  // Preferences Viewer (SharedPreferences, DataStore, NSUserDefaults)
  implementation("com.livewire-kt.livewire:plugin-preferences:<version>")

  // Jetpack Compose Recomposition Viewer
  implementation("com.livewire-kt.livewire:plugin-recomposition:<version>")
}
```

The client library ships as a Kotlin Multiplatform artifact with Android, iOS, and JVM targets — add it to `commonMain` in a KMP project, or directly to an Android app.

## 2. Create and start a client

Create a `LivewireClient`, install the plugins you want, and start it:

```kotlin
val livewireClient = LivewireClient {
  install(DatabasePlugin(context))
  install(NetworkPlugin())
  install(PreferencesPlugin(context))
  install(MyCustomPlugin())
}

livewireClient.start()
```

`start()` begins broadcasting a discovery packet so the host can find your app, and connects to the host once one is listening. Call `stop()` to shut it down.

!!! tip "Recommendation: debug builds only"
    Livewire is a development tool. Gate it behind a debug source set or a build-type check so the server never ships in a release build.

## 3. Run the host

macOS:

```bash
brew install --cask livewire-kt/tap/livewire
```

or

```bash
brew tap livewire-kt/tap
brew install --cask livewire
```

Until publishing is configured for other platforms, you may run the host app from source:

```bash
./gradlew :host:run
```

## 4. Connect

With your app running on a connected device, emulator, or the same machine, the host discovers it automatically:

- **Android** — devices and emulators visible to `adb devices`
- **iOS** — devices connected over USB, simulators connected through localhost
- **Desktop** — Livewire apps running on the same machine

Select your app in the host's device list to connect. The host performs an encrypted handshake and your installed plugins appear as panels, live.
